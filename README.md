# Mobile Flashcards

My implementation of the final assessment project Udacity's React Native course. The app bootstrapped with [expo/create-react-native-app](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app).

## Description

An iOS mobile app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create decks of flashcards, add new cards to decks and take quizzes.

## App Notifications

The app will show a notification to the user at 17:00 everyday, if no quiz is completed that day.

## Setup Instructions

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the app with `npm start`
